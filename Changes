          Make many obvious (to a computer, I hope) references to the fact 
          that this requires perl 5.14, to prevent the bloody annoying 
          CPAN Testers emails. Note that I chose to do this rather than 
          make the module compatible with earlier versions.

          Add two parameters for min and max neuron output values, default to 
          0 and 1. Conveniently, forget to actually implement that. 

          Less conveniently, remember to implement the above.
          
          While implementing the above, also implement an activation function 
          in the form of a coderef passed to the AI::ANN constructor.
          
          Add the Evolver module, and tests for it. Ensure that the AI::ANN
          objects that Evolver returns have the same parameters as did the 
          original.

          Chase down a few bugs caused by a combination of evil references
          and me changing the structure of my objects halfway through coding.
          
          Yell at myself a little bit for taunting the ghost of the (not yet 
          dead) Larry Wall, by claiming that I was 'halfway through coding'.
